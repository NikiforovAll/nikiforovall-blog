I prefer reading books from cover to cover and taking notes quite frequently. At the same, I tend to have multiple items on my reading list. It feels frustrating to get back to an awesome book and realize I need to revision it all over again. So I decided to organize it a little bit. I think the best way to organize the learning process is to envision the end goal and have sensible timelines.

For the sake of simplicity, I use google spreadsheets as storage and [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/) as a visualization tool. *XMind* is a great tool to visualize and [brainstorm](https://babokpage.wordpress.com/techniques/brainstorming/) some ideas.

### üí° My take on it

* Determine the list of books and materials to learn for the next sprint (e.g. quarter, half of a year)
* Set priority and categorize
* Add corresponding notes to [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) for each book, course, etc. It is quite easy to generate internal link in *Evernote* and access it from spreadsheet directly.
* Generate mindmap and play with it so it is possible to estimate and create a plan to take further actions.
* Manage progress and perform retrospective when you feel you need it. üîÅ

### Books for .NET Developer

### Build mindmaps programmatically

I've created library [XMindCSharp](https://nikiforovall.github.io/xmindcsharp/) for .NET to build mindmaps that you can open with ([XMind](https://www.xmind.net/)).
You can work with it like this:

```csharp
var book = new XMindConfiguration()
                .WithFileWriter("./output", zip: true)
                .CreateWorkBook(workbookName: "test.xmind");
var rootTopic = book.GetPrimarySheet()
    .GetRootTopic();
rootTopic.SetTitle("Scope");
rootTopic.Add(epicTopic);
//...
```

Also, I've developed simple CLI application [edu-scope-to-mindmap](https://github.com/NikiforovAll/edu-scope-to-mindmap) to create mindmaps from excel spreadsheet I've mentioned above.

To use it, run next command from project directory:

```bash
$ dotnet run --path ./ouput --name test.xmind --source-path input/input.xlsx
```

Sometimes it is hard to pick a bite that I can chew on üòÜ.

### Summary

I've introduced lightweight approach to organize your learning process. Personally, I find it useful because learning is essential part of my craft and you better do it well üòâ.

If you want to organize you learning process the way I do, please feel free to use: [template.xlsx](https://github.com/NikiforovAll/nikiforovall.github.io/blob/master/assets/edu-scope/Template.xlsx) + [edu-scope-to-mindmap](https://github.com/NikiforovAll/edu-scope-to-mindmap)
